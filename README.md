# Micheal Xing’s Fonts
A collection of Micheal Xing’s typefaces which are published under the SIL Open Font License. These fonts were downloaded from https://fontstruct.com/fontstructors/223790/ifuturemix

## Note
I have included autohinted versions of the typefaces for testing purposes too, processed with [TTF Autohint](https://freetype.org/ttfautohint/) v1.8.4

## Project status
New fonts could be added if I have time.
